# Smart-Solar-Scheduling-using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning to optimize solar energy for EV charging and home use. By integrating real-time weather data and solar panel performance, it predicts solar availability and schedules energy consumption efficiently. A Tableau dashboard helps homeowners make data-driven decisions, reducing grid dependence and lowering costs.
